# VirtualCatalog

This package includes models and associated logic used by VirtualBuddy to inspect and resolve downloadable restore images for macOS virtual machines.

The catalog itself is a JSON file stored in the VirtualBuddy GitHub repository.

Adding new releases to the catalog can be done with the [ipswu tool](https://github.com/insidegui/ipswu) (currently private, will be made open soon).
